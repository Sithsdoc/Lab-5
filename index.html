          This is a very brief overview of the
          <strong>Transformers</strong> timeline, pulling from the games
          Transformers War/Fall of Crybertron, and the first generation tv show.

          The war started on cybertron, the home planet of the transformers,
          <strong>Megatron</strong> (the leader of the decepticons) wanted to
          rule cybertron and rallied allies to him, this group of Transformes
          was later known as the Decepticons. The other faction is called the
          Autobots who fight to keep the freedom that every sentient being
          deserves, and thus a war that lasted millions of years started. The
          leadership of the Autobots were transformers that earned the title
          prime from the council (a group of older, non-combatant transformers),
          after Megatron killed many of them,
          <strong>Optimus Prime</strong> became the final prime.

          As the war continued it shifted from conquering the world to fighting
          over the planet's remaining supply of Energon (the life blood of all
          transformers). Eventually the core of the planet shut down due to
          Megatron infecting it with dark energon (a highly deadly antithesis of
          energon) and thus the Transformers had to leave the planet to survive.
          This led to the Transformers leaving the planet and ending up on Earth
          where they laid in stasis since the times of the dinosaurs.
